				<h1> Perhaps an Exploration of the Female Gaze. </h1>
				<p> Additionally, Tina is granted a high degree of sexual motivation, and even granted a female gaze. In the episode Bad Tina we open in an imaginary sequence where Tina, Jimmy Junior (her perpetual crush), and a zombie boy are in a triangle grabbing each other’s butts after creating a love potion in science class. These imagined sequences are often brought up as Tina’s self-descried erotic friend fiction (because she has exhausted the universe of erotic fan fiction). Later, when the kids get to school, Tina is tasked with showing the new girl Tammy around the school. Tammy continuously pushes Tina to commit rebellious actions, like skipping class or getting piercings, and to prove she is more on the edge than Tammy thinks, Tina show her a peep hole she found that peers into the boys’ locker room. Here the camera gives a physical female gaze as we see through the hole with them into the locker room, where we can see the feet of a group of boys. Perhaps this is also displaying a complex view of female attraction, as well general network television censorship of a tumultuous topic. This particular episode comes to head when Tammy steals Tina’s erotic friend fiction journal and threatens to read it aloud to the entire school. Nervous to go to school the next day, she pretends to be sick and when Linda finds out the reason for her avoidance, she tells her, “Only you can embarrass yourself.” Tina takes this advice to mean she should get ahead of the situation and read her erotic journals before Tammy can, and that is exactly what she does. Initially the school kids begin to laugh but their ridicule is drawn to Tammy after she laugh-farts in front of everyone. Perhaps a problematic resolution to ridicule a girl for such a natural act that is stereotypically thought of as un-lady-like, but perhaps also this is an act of narrative punishment. With that aside, Tina discovers that her sexuality is not embarrassing, it is a part of her, and she should be confident in herself and proud of her creativity.
