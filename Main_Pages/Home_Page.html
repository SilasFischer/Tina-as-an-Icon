				<h1> Unashamed, Tina Belcher Belches. Except Sometimes </h1>
				<p> Aside from the title name being denoted by the masculine patriarch of the family, Bob’s Burgers could easily be described as a series of misadventures and self-discoveries of three adolescent and prepubescent children, rounded out with some feel-good examples of parental support. Among these three children, Tina, age thirteen, is the most dynamic and interesting character to explore through a non-normative lens of gender roles. She is in the midst of an awkward puberty exploring her sexuality and searching for self-identity. At first glance, what might appear like a boiler plate animated situational comedy might not seem like an apt vehicle for analyzing gender roles but, there are several advantages to using such a device. First off, they have gained massive popularity which grants them a far reaching and diverse audience for impression. Additionally, animated characters do not ever need to age. Tina is able to stay thirteen for thirteen seasons and counting. Furthermore, the form of the sitcom disregards the need for narrative progression, the algorithm prefers when everything at the end of an episode returns to how it was at the beginning. It is in these latter two points where the strengths of Bob’s Burgers emerges; the ability to create a dynamic, complex, contradictory, and malleable portrait of girlhood and adolescence through the character of Tina, as much as a nationally syndicated animated sitcom on fox is able to.
