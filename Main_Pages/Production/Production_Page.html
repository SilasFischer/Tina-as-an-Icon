				<h1> The Production is Important </h1>
				<p> Episodes come and go, and Tina is growing and changing throughout each of them. She is able to display characteristics that are diverse and contradictory; she can be one thing and the other and nothing is off limits because nothing is permanent. “Animations ‘rejection of once-and-forever allotted form’ – it is this inherent mutability” (Barnett). She can be rewritten in a later episode and that it alright, and it does not mean the previous episodes were wrong or forgotten.  Instead, everything exists in truth simultaneously, elements of her personhood can be reversed or overlapped; girlhood is complex and interpersonal. With this open and complex representation, it may not be surprising to hear that five of eleven writers are women, as is the co-runner. As for Tina Belcher, she is voiced by a man, Dan Mintz, so a question lingers, are they only able to get away with this handling because of this act of transvestitism?
