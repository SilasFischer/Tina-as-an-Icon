				<h1> Animations Tumultuous History with Girls. </h1>
				<p> What makes Bob’s Burgers unique is the way it allows Tina to navigate this space. The histories of other animated comedies are no secret. Often women, and in particular girls, are ridiculed and mocked or used as placeholders for the sexual desires of men<sup>2</sup>. This often comes at the expense of their vulnerability and naiveite. This is not to say Tina does not display these characteristics, and that these are not used for laughs, but they are balanced by other moments when she is confident, self-assured, and perceptive.
				</p>
				<h1> Smart, Confident, Gulable, Insecure, Clumbsy, Graceful, Yes, And. </h1>
				<p> Take for example the events in the episode Broadcast Wagstaff School News. Tina begins the episode auditioning for the schools broadcast journalism club, and right before the audition her friend/enemy Tammy tells Tina to speak slowly because she is normally a fast talker (which she is absolutely not). Her audition is a disaster, with drawn out syllables that take forever to say. Tammy, auditioning for the same part, wins the role by taking advantage of Tina’s gullibility. As Tina is moping around the halls, she runs into the janitor who is mopping up dog poop that was dragged into the school. He says it was the second time that week it happened, and Tina, perceptibly, is the first to suspect that it might not be dragged in dog poop, but a student purposefully pooping in the school. Supported by her sister Louise, Tina decides to investigate the mystery on her own after Mr. Grant, the journalism instructor, turns down the story as being unworthy. Together the two sisters captivate the school with their reporting and draw envy from Mr. Grant and the Journalism club, who attempt to frame her as the “mad pooper” until she clears her name by catching a boy named Zeke in the act. In this single episode, Tina is able to display a contradictory array of personality traits, both naive and perceptive, timid and self-assured. At the end of the episode, she is granted a position on the school staff and given her own segment “Tina’s Corner.” In her segment she is wearing a green blazer in front of a green screen, so the broadcasted effect is just her head floating above a counter. Again, she displays a high level of unawareness, but it does not matter all that much. She is confident about the story she delivers and delivers the information as just a talking head. As a bonus, she even is commenting on the archetypical news caster, one who is usually traditionally beautiful, but Tina has no body here, her voice becomes the focal point.
