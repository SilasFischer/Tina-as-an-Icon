				<h1> As a Form, Animation Alters Spatio-temporal Relationships </h1>
				<p> Animation allows our suspended disbelief to be hoisted to its limits, stretching and thinning the thread to the point just before it separates, and we lose the ability to relate to the characters on the screen. Animation, traditional 2-D animation like what is used in Bob’s Burgers, is created through a series of individual drawings, static frames, played in rapid succession to create the illusion of movement. Quick motion of an object could be described as a series of amorphous blobs, but when the object slows down, it regains its original shape. While recognized by the viewer as going through this metamorphous, we believe the solid object moved from point A to B. Jerry can smack Tom in the face with a frying pan, flattening it into a single line for a moment before Tom grabs his nose, stretches his face out and snaps it back into place. This is not seen as unbelievable, but as an aspect of the medium. Animation allows us to temporarily enter a world where the impossible becomes possible, while still allowing us to recognize and reflect ourselves upon human (or anthropomorphized) characters. 
				</p>
				<h1> Traditional Timelines can be Cast Aside </h1>
				<p> Because the individual frames are static, drawn illustrations, the audience has no issue accepting a world that is both frozen in and removed from time. The characters never have to age, or grow, or progress, and yet there can be thirteen different Halloweens, Christmases, and Thanksgivings without threat of contradiction to the timeline, even when characters reference events from past episodes, because there is none. The audience is immediately accepting and perceptive of the non-linear nature of the show. Due to the repetitive and cyclical nature of this kind of storytelling, characters are able display multiple facets of their personality, often simultaneously<sup>1</sup>.
				</p>
				<h1> This Non-linear Construction is Key </h1>
				<p> This non-linear construction plays directly into the shows ability to display Tina in a complex, and progressive, light. Season one contains one of the few moments of time marking when Tina has her 13th birthday party, a party in which Linda, her mother, says, “This is the year she becomes a woman.” The notion that Tina is in the fluctuating period of adolescence, not entirely a woman but not entirely a girl either, is an essential backdrop to frame her character for the entirety of the series, and for this reason this event must happen so early in the shows development. “Christine Griffin argues, ‘there is nothing essential about girlhood’ rather, it should be recognized as a site of production, negotiation, and cultural-political construction”<sup>1</sup>. There is no core component that defines what it means to be a girl and as such there are no essential characterizes that Tina must display in order to be one. Instead, this actually points to a notion that girlhood is in flux, it is malleable and changes. It is explored, defined, redefined with no end point. “Marion Brown suggests that that girlhood is a place where meaning is ‘collectively produced and reproduced, always shifting, neither static nor linear’”<sup>1</sup>. In the first season we are supplied with one of the only points of linearity, a birthday, and for thirteen seasons since, Tina has continued to be thirteen, repeatedly searching and discovering what her girlhood entails in a non-linear, complex, and occasionally contradictory way.
